Hi! I'm a **Computational Physicist** with expertise in developing fast algorithms for real-time data selection.

My main contributions to software codebases are from my work with the **LHCb collaboration**, where I help develop the GPU-based software trigger, **Allen**. You can explore my merge requests to [Allen](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Allen/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&author_username=acasaisv).

### My most significant contributions include:  
- Implementing a standalone reconstruction of muon trajectories.  
- Developing online feature-building algorithms for electron and muon identification.  
- Evaluating dense neural network models for improved performance.
- Developing the  interface to output data to ROOT files from algorithms.
